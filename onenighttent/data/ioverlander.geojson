On the link below you can find all the infos (in German) - In case you don't speak german: short info - 3 days parking, free. Electricity, water etc you pay with coins. Toilets are at the kiosk, but they might be closed by night. Showers: you can go into the town swimming pool (pay for the evening ticket) there you shower. Only open between May and August.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure, but I don't think someone will recognize if you stay longer than three days. But we never tried out. \r\n\r\nBe aware: Heilbronn has the \"environment badge\" (Umweltplakette) - if you travel Germany you might already recognize. Here you need a green one.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.heilbronn-tourist.de/hn_content.asphmg=4xx44xx0xx0xx0&lang=01\r\n\r\nABOUT HEILBRONN:\r\n\r\nEnjoy the city, go for a walk at the riverside to town. There are tons of restaurant you can eat at. From vegan food at \"Velo\" & \"Grüne Pause\" to vietnam food at \"My Sapa\" or regular good food at \"Charivari\". If you are there in summer, visit the \"Kaffeebucht\" it's very close to this point. If you go out for a beer, there are also tons of bars. Young people really enjoy the \"Data 77112\". Lots of open minded people from all over. \r\n\r\nIf you want to swim, the town swimming pool is also right next to this place. If you need groceries and daily stuff there are also many stores around. Best (in my eyes) is \"Edeka\" - everything we listed here you can google to find the adresses.

I recommend going all the way to the back of the campsite, as these are the farthest from the crowd that camps next to the river, and you'll have a small creek all for yourself! Drawback is that the nearest watertap is quite a long walk away and there is no power available there. Also, the toilets and showers are on the other side of the campsite.

The management warned me of bike theft. It is pretty easy to pick up a bike and carry it across the fence. They have created a fenced cage where you can store your bike, it gets locked at night. There is a tiny store, I have not used it as there are supermarkets nearby. \r\n\r\nMinus points:\r\n- When it rains, draining the water away can be problematic, water puddles appear.\r\n- Even though the camping site is located at the edge of the city, there is a some background noise. There is a suspension bridge nearby with a lot of traffic. The traffic on the river is noisy too.\r\n\r\nPlus points:\r\n- Nice relaxed atmosphere.\r\n- Large trees provide shade in hot weather.\r\n- View of the river Rhein.\r\n- At cycling distance from the city center.\r\n\r\nOverall it is pretty good, It is a nice relaxed, no frills camping site.
